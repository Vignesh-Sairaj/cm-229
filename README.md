# CM 229 - Phenotype Prediction / Imputation

## Things we'd like to try
- KNN
- Matrix Factorization
- Linear Regression 
- Phenotype only
- Genotype only
- Mixed effects model

## Other Approaches
- Choosing a few SNPs to act as fixed effects in the model
- Nonlinear scaling as suggested by Fusi et al., 2014.
- A full Bayesian Mixture Model as in Dahl et al.
